# Permahistory
:exclamation: LEFT AS UNFINISHED

## Purpose
Purpose of this project is to create permanent notes, diaries, future thoughts etc.
- You can make a guess for the 2050 about the life outside Earth.
- You can send a future note to yourself or your children for 2030.
- You can write permanent diaries both publicly and privately.
- You can write your testaments.

Everything you write will be permanently stored on **Arweave Blockchain**, as well as this website (will be deployed to blockchain).

## To Do
- [x] Option to connect with Arweave Web Wallet as well as ArConnect.
- [ ] Functionality to send messages to future and allow decryption only at certain date. (I'll check Smartweave for this, i don't exactly know how to achieve this in decentralized way.)
- [ ] Send writings as mails at certain date. (Again i don't exactly know how to achieve this, i'll search.)
- [ ] Pagination for history.
- [ ] Bundling or grouping writings.
- [ ] Writing testaments.
- [ ] Search, Like and Save feature.
- [ ] Uploading certificates and other important documents that people have.
- [ ] Paying transaction fees with different coins or tokens (ETH, LINK etc.) that can be swappable to AR, or maybe without swapping. (If it's possible)
