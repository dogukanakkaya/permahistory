# Permahistory


## Purpose
Purpose of this project is to create permanent notes, diaries, future thoughts etc.
- You can make a guess for the 2050 about the life outside Earth.
- You can send a future note to yourself or your children for 2030.
- You can write permanent diaries both publicly and privately.

Everything you write will be permanently stored on **Arweave Blockchain**, as well as this website (will be deployed to blockchain).

## What has been done so far?
Home page, history page, writing page stylings are completed. There is still things to do for both functionality and styling.

You can now create public writings and see those in history page.

## What's left to be done
- About, FAQ, Learn Permahistory pages (static).
- Private writings and My History page (interactive).
- Some styling and code refactoring.
- Option to connect with Arweave Web Wallet as well as ArConnect.
- Functionality to send messages to future and allow encryption only at certain date. (I'll check Smartweave for this, i don't exactly know how to achieve this in decentralized way.)
- Send writings as mails at certain date. (Again i don't exactly know how to achieve this, i'll search.)
